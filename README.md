# Lending-Club

## An exploration of Lending Club's loan data from 2007-2018 



return on investments (including losses for 'charged off') by loan grade for non-current loans
expected return vs actual on loans paid off early

check for rejected status?? - very few - drop
interest rates correlate directly to grade?
good vs. bad loans? (what to do with current loans? only paid off or charged off? all "bad" stauses binned together) - classifier? (its what everyone does)
interest rate calculator reverse engineering (disregard grade?- external factors only)
as above grade classifier - external factors only
geography? (racial makeup??)
can i reverse engineer gender somehow? (m vs f disbalanced jobs {nurses vs drivers} with similar income levels  - compare interest rates/grading?)
loan purpose cleanup - NLP?
