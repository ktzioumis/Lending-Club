EDA

categorize features - borrower features (income, employment, inquiries, home ownership), loan features- (date, interest, grade, hardship, status)

interest rates by grade - boxplots

return on investments (including losses for 'charged off') by loan grade for non-current loans
expected return vs actual on loans paid off early

interest rate by homeownership

grade? vs income? vs employment title? vs dti?

hardship outcomes?
recoveries for hardship flag? 



check for rejected status?? - very few - drop
interest rates correlate directly to grade?
good vs. bad loans? (what to do with current loans? only paid off or charged off? all "bad" stauses binned together) - classifier? (its what everyone does)
interest rate calculator reverse engineering (disregard grade?- external factors only)
as above grade classifier - external factors only
geography? (racial makeup??)
can i reverse engineer gender somehow? (m vs f disbalanced jobs {nurses vs drivers} with similar income levels  - compare interest rates/grading?)
loan purpose cleanup - NLP?
